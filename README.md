======

A collection of Python tools for performing Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection for stochastic processes. The initial roadmap is to implement exact likelihood inference for the following common continuous time stochastic processes :

* Wiener process
* Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
* Brownian dynamics process
* general one-dimensional drift-diffusion process

These exact likelihood inference methods will serve as a benchmark for approximation schemes for process likelihoods. Model selection and change point detection methods will be implemented after the above methods have been implemented.

Contributions and ideas are welcome!
